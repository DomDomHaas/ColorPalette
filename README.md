ColorImporter
=============

ColorImporter is a plugin for Unity which supports loading in Palettes from www.pltts.me / www.colourlovers.com (by now)

Following things are needed:
- HtmlSharp (HtmlParser: https://github.com/wallerdev/htmlsharp extract the "HtmlSharp" folder into your asset folder)
- JSONPersistent Unity Tool (is included)
- The Playersettings "API Compatibility Level" of Unity has to be set to ".NET 2.0" NOT ".NET 2.0 subset" (otherwise the System.Web is missing)
